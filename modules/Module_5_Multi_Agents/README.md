# Module 5: Multi-Agent Systems & the Protocol Layer

This module is about what happens when a single agent is no longer enough. Real systems are
built from **many specialized agents** that have to discover each other, exchange messages, and
call shared tools — without collapsing into a tangle of point-to-point glue code. The answer is a
**protocol layer**: a small set of standards that let agents and tools talk to each other the same
way regardless of who built them.

You'll learn the three protocols that matter most in practice, and how they fit together:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — the standard way to expose *tools and data sources* to an
  agent. Instead of hard-coding database calls into your agent, you run an MCP server and the agent
  discovers the tools at runtime.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** — the standard way for *agents to call other agents* as independent
  services. Each agent publishes an "agent card" describing what it can do, and others invoke it
  over JSON-RPC 2.0 / HTTP — including streaming responses.
- **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** — Google's framework for *defining* the agents themselves:
  single LLM agents, sequential pipelines, and the runner that drives their execution.

The throughline of the course is **"from efficiency to action"** — this is the *action* end, where
agents stop being standalone chatbots and start coordinating as a system.

## What You'll Learn

- Why a **protocol layer** beats bespoke integration glue once you have more than one agent or tool
- How to expose database operations as **MCP tools** instead of baking them into agent code
- How to run agents as **independent A2A microservices** that discover and call each other
- How to build agents with **Google ADK** — `LlmAgent`, `SequentialAgent` pipelines, and the `Runner`
- How these three layers compose into one working system: ADK *defines* the agents, A2A *connects*
  them, MCP *feeds* them tools
- How to put a **multi-layer security pipeline** in front of a multi-agent system (input
  sanitization, an LLM security judge, and PII masking on the way out)

## Companion Notebook: How Skills Work Under the Hood

**[`how_skills_work_under_the_hood.ipynb`](how_skills_work_under_the_hood.ipynb)**
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rkarmaka/multi-agent-course/blob/main/modules/Module_5_Multi_Agents/how_skills_work_under_the_hood.ipynb)

A short, runnable peek behind the curtain of **Agent Skills**. It takes the `market-sizing` skill and
shows that a skill is — at its core — **just a markdown file of instructions**, then rebuilds its
behavior from scratch on the raw **Anthropic Python SDK**, one step at a time:

- A skill is a `SKILL.md` file: **frontmatter** (routing metadata) + **body** (the instructions).
- Stripping the frontmatter and passing the body as the **`system`** prompt is the whole trick.
- What an Anthropic API call actually looks like — `system` vs `messages`, and the response's
  **content blocks**.
- Why the model is **stateless**, and how a `history` list gives a conversation memory.
- An **ablation** (same question, no system prompt) that makes visible exactly what the skill buys you.
- How running a skill *in Claude Code* differs from running it *via the SDK* (triggering, tools, memory).

It's **Colab-ready**: hit the badge above (or *Runtime → Run all*) — it installs the SDK, pulls the
skill file from GitHub, and reads your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from Colab **Secrets**. Running locally
works too; the setup cells fall back to a `.env` file or a hidden prompt.

> **Why it's here:** Module 5 is about coordinating *many* agents, but every agent in the capstone is
> still driven by instructions fed to a model. This notebook grounds that intuition at the smallest
> possible scale — one instruction file, one API call — before you scale up to ADK agents talking over
> A2A and MCP.

## The Project: Advanced Customer Support Agent

**[`advance-customer-support-agent-feature-A2A-MCP-ADK/`](advance-customer-support-agent-feature-A2A-MCP-ADK/)**

A CLI customer-support chatbot that ties all three protocols together in one running system. It's a
deliberately small but realistic example: a support agent that can look up orders, modify them under
business rules, and remember past conversations — wrapped in a security pipeline that runs as its own
set of agents.

How the pieces map to the module's concepts:

| Concept | Where it shows up in the project |
|---|---|
| **ADK** | The support agent, the Security Judge, and the Data Masker are all ADK `LlmAgent`s (Gemini 2.5 Flash); the Judge → Mask pipeline is a `SequentialAgent`. |
| **A2A** | The Judge (port `10002`) and Masker (port `10003`) run as standalone A2A servers; the CLI calls them over JSON-RPC for every request and refuses to start if they're unreachable. |
| **MCP** | Database operations (`get-order-status`, `find-customer-orders`, `update-order-status`) are exposed through the **MCP Toolbox** server, not hard-coded into the agent. |
| **Security pipeline** | Input sanitization → an A2A Security Judge (100+ regex patterns) → the agent → A2A PII masking via Google Cloud DLP on the way out. |

The project's own [`README.md`](advance-customer-support-agent-feature-A2A-MCP-ADK/README.md) has the
full prerequisites, step-by-step setup (PostgreSQL, MCP Toolbox, A2A servers, the CLI), the request
flow, and a troubleshooting guide. Start there once you've got the conceptual picture above.

## Environment Setup

The capstone targets **Python 3.12+**. Create an isolated conda environment before installing:

```bash
conda create -y -n customer-support python=3.12   # creates Python 3.12.x
conda activate customer-support
cd advance-customer-support-agent-feature-A2A-MCP-ADK
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See the project [`README.md`](advance-customer-support-agent-feature-A2A-MCP-ADK/README.md#3--python-dependencies)
for the full dependency setup (Phoenix observability + OTel pinning).
