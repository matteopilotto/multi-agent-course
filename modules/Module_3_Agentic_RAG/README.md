# Module 3: Agentic RAG

This module teaches you how to build intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that **reason before they retrieve**. Rather than routing every query through a single static pipeline, you'll learn how to give your RAG system *agency* — the ability to choose the right knowledge source, optimize for speed with semantic caching, and handle time-sensitive queries with live web search. You'll also explore **Knowledge Graphs** as a structured retrieval backend and learn when graph-based retrieval beats vector search — the foundation of hybrid memory.

By the end of this module you will have built a full agentic RAG pipeline from scratch, plus a RAG-vs-Knowledge-Graph evaluation framework — all without relying on any external agentic framework (no LangChain, no LlamaIndex).

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to use an LLM as a **query router** to dynamically pick the right retrieval backend
- How to build and populate a **vector database** (Qdrant) from raw PDF documents
- How **semantic caching** works and why it dramatically reduces latency and cost
- How to detect and handle **time-sensitive queries** that must never be served from cache
- How to combine document retrieval, vector search, and live web search into one coherent pipeline
- How to build a **Knowledge Graph** in Neo4j and query it with **Text-to-Cypher** instead of vector search
- How to objectively compare RAG vs Knowledge Graph answers with an **LLM-as-judge** evaluation framework

## Notebooks

### 1. Upload Data to Qdrant
**`Agentic_RAG/Upload_data_to_Qdrant_Notebook.ipynb`**

Before you can retrieve anything you need to build your vector store. This notebook walks through the full document ingestion pipeline:

- Extract text from PDFs using **PyMuPDF**
- Chunk documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (2 048-char chunks, 50-char overlap)
- Generate **768-dimensional embeddings** using `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`
- Upload vectors with metadata to two **Qdrant** collections:
  - `opnai_data` — OpenAI Agents official documentation
  - `10k_data` — Uber 2021 and Lyft 2020–2024 SEC 10-K filings

> The pre-built `qdrant_data/` directory is already included in the repo so you can skip this step and jump straight into querying. Run this notebook only if you want to rebuild the index or add your own documents.

---

### 2. Agentic RAG
**`Agentic_RAG/Agentic_RAG_Notebook.ipynb`**

The core of this module. This notebook introduces **agentic decision-making** as the first step in a RAG pipeline — the system thinks before it retrieves.

#### How it works

```

#### Key components

| Function | Role |
|---|---|
| `route_query()` | Calls GPT-4o with a router prompt; returns `action`, `reason`, and a short `answer` as JSON |
| `get_text_embeddings()` | Converts a query string to a 768-dim Nomic vector |
| `retrieve_and_response()` | Async function — queries Qdrant (top-3 chunks) then calls the RAG generator |
| `rag_formatted_response()` | Passes retrieved context to GPT-4 and asks it to answer with inline citations |
| `get_internet_content()` | Calls the SerpApi Google Search API for real-time answers |
| `agentic_rag()` | Main orchestrator — ties routing, retrieval, and generation together |

#### Data sources
- **OpenAI documentation** — Agents, tools, chat completions, best practices
- **10-K SEC filings** — Uber 2021 and Lyft 2020–2024 financial data
- **Live internet** — Any query outside the above two domains via SerpApi

#### Assignment
Implement **sub-query division** — split compound questions (e.g. *"What was Uber's and Lyft's revenue in 2021?"*) into individual sub-queries and process each one through the agentic pipeline independently.

### 3. Semantic Cache from Scratch
**`Semantic_Cache/Semantic_cache_from_scratch.ipynb`**

Builds a semantic cache without using any high-level caching library. The goal is to understand exactly how vector-based answer reuse works under the hood.

#### How it works

                   Return cached           Traversaal Pro RAG
                   answer  ⚡              (AWS Guidebook)
                   ~0.1–0.2 s             Store → Return
                                          ~6–8 s
```

#### What gets cached

```
cache.json
{
  "questions"    : ["What is S3?", …],
  "embeddings"   : [[0.12, -0.43, …], …],   ← 768-dim Nomic vectors
  "answers"      : [{ full API response }, …],
  "response_text": ["An S3 bucket is …", …]
}
```

The FAISS `IndexFlatL2` is rebuilt in-memory from the JSON file on every load, so the cache survives notebook restarts.

#### Routing decision at a glance

| Query type | Backend | Cached? | Typical latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Temporal keyword detected | SerpApi (live Google) | No | 0.1–1.5 s |
| Stable — FAISS hit (dist ≤ 0.2) | JSON store | Already stored | 0.1–0.2 s |
| Stable — FAISS miss (dist > 0.2) | Traversaal Pro RAG | Stored after call | 6–8 s |

#### External APIs used
- **Traversaal Pro** — hosted RAG over the AWS Guidebook corpus (`POST https://pro-documents.traversaal-api.com/documents/search`)
- **SerpApi** — real-time Google search results (`GET https://serpapi.com/search.json`)

### 4. Agentic RAG with Semantic Cache
**`Agentic_RAG_with_Semantic_Cache.ipynb`** + **`rag_helpers.py`**

This notebook combines everything — it wraps the full three-way agentic RAG pipeline from Notebook 2 inside the semantic cache layer from Notebook 3. The result is a system that is both *intelligent* (routes queries to the right source) and *efficient* (avoids redundant calls for similar questions).

All implementation lives in `rag_helpers.py` so the notebook stays minimal and focused on demonstrating system behaviour. After a `git clone` and a single `init_rag()` call, the entire pipeline is available via one function: `agentic_rag_with_cache(query, cache)`.

#### `rag_helpers.py` — what's inside

| Symbol | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `init_rag(openai_api_key, serp_api_key, qdrant_path)` | function | One-time setup — loads Nomic model, wires OpenAI client, Qdrant, and SerpApi |
| `SemanticCaching` | class | FAISS-backed cache with time-sensitivity filter, JSON persistence, `check_cache()` / `add_to_cache()` |
| `get_internet_content(query)` | function | Live Google search via SerpApi |
| `route_query(query)` | function | GPT-4o router returning `OPENAI_QUERY`, `10K_DOCUMENT_QUERY`, or `INTERNET_QUERY` |
| `agentic_rag_with_cache(query, cache)` | function | **Public entry point** — cache check → route → retrieve → store → return |

#### Full combined pipeline

### 5. Knowledge Graphs

**`Knowledge_Graphs/`**

A parallel track that swaps vector search for **structured graph retrieval**. Where the agentic RAG notebooks embed text and search by similarity, here you build a **Knowledge Graph** in Neo4j and answer questions by generating **Cypher queries** from natural language — then measure which approach wins, query by query.

#### Notebooks

| Notebook | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `knowledge_graph_neo4j_with_evals.ipynb` | The main notebook — builds RAG **and** KG pipelines from scratch, runs them side by side, and uses an **LLM judge** (GPT-4o-mini) to score each answer on accuracy, completeness, and precision. Dataset: researchers / articles / topics. |
| `Knowledge_Graphs/Knowledge_Graphs_Basic_Version.ipynb` | Graph RAG fundamentals — construct a hotel-reviews knowledge graph, migrate it to Neo4j, and build a template-based retriever. |
| `Knowledge_Graphs/Knowledge_Graphs_Advanced_Version.ipynb` | Extends the basic graph with **LLM-driven graph enrichment** (entity/relationship extraction from unstructured text) and **vector indexing** on graph nodes for hybrid structural + semantic retrieval. |

#### Three query methods compared

| Method | How it answers | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **RAG** | Semantic / keyword search over documents → LLM generation | Explanations, summaries, fuzzy natural-language questions |
| **Knowledge Graph (Text-to-Cypher)** | NL question → Cypher → query Neo4j directly | Precise counts, relationships, aggregations, filtering |
| **LLM Judge** | GPT-4o-mini scores both answers and recommends a winner | Deciding *when to use which* — objectively |

#### Streamlit app

Beyond the notebooks, `Knowledge_Graphs/` ships a runnable Streamlit app (`app.py`) with side-by-side RAG-vs-KG comparison and interactive **Pyvis** graph visualizations (full graph + query-specific subgraph). Run `python setup.py` once to load data, then `streamlit run app.py`. See `Knowledge_Graphs/README.md` for the full walkthrough.

## Key Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agentic RAG** | An LLM reasons about *where* to search before it searches |
| **Query routing** | GPT-4o classifies queries into routing categories via a structured JSON prompt |
| **Vector embeddings** | Text is converted to 768-dim dense vectors using Nomic's embedding model |
| **Vector database (Qdrant)** | Embeddings are stored and searched by cosine/L2 similarity |
| **Semantic caching** | Previously seen (or semantically similar) queries are answered from cache instead of hitting the API again |
| **Time-sensitivity detection** | Keyword-based filter routes live queries to a web search API, bypassing the cache entirely |
| **RAG with citations** | Retrieved chunks are passed to an LLM which generates grounded answers with `[1][2]`-style references |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Entities and relationships are modeled as nodes and edges in Neo4j for structured retrieval |
| **Text-to-Cypher** | An LLM translates a natural-language question into a Cypher query executed directly on the graph |
| **Hybrid retrieval** | Combining structural (graph) and semantic (vector) retrieval, and choosing the right one per query |
| **LLM-as-judge evaluation** | An impartial LLM scores RAG vs KG answers on accuracy, completeness, and precision |

---

## Setup

### API keys required

| Key | Used in |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Query routing and RAG generation (all notebooks) |
| `SERP_API_KEY` | Live Google search (Agentic RAG, combined, and Semantic Cache notebooks) |
| `traversaal_pro_api_key` | Hosted RAG over AWS Guidebook (Semantic Cache notebook only) |
| `NEO4J_URI` / `NEO4J_USERNAME` / `NEO4J_PASSWORD` | Neo4j Aura connection (Knowledge Graphs track only) |

**On Google Colab** — add keys to the Secrets panel (lock icon in the left sidebar).

**Locally** — create a `.env` file in `Module_3_Agentic_RAG/`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
SERP_API_KEY=...
traversaal_pro_api_key=...
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install openai qdrant-client transformers sentence-transformers \
            faiss-cpu torch numpy requests python-dotenv \
            langchain-text-splitters pymupdf einops nest_asyncio
```

> The **Knowledge Graphs** track has its own dependencies (Neo4j, Streamlit, Pyvis, Plotly).
> Install them separately with `pip install -r Knowledge_Graphs/requirements.txt`.

### Recommended notebook order

1. `Agentic_RAG/Agentic_RAG_Notebook.ipynb` — start here to understand the routing architecture
2. `Agentic_RAG/Upload_data_to_Qdrant_Notebook.ipynb` — optional, only if you want to rebuild the vector index
3. `Semantic_Cache/Semantic_cache_from_scratch.ipynb` — understand caching mechanics in isolation
4. `Agentic_RAG_with_Semantic_Cache.ipynb` — the complete combined system
5. `Knowledge_Graphs/knowledge_graph_neo4j_with_evals.ipynb` — structured retrieval: RAG vs Knowledge Graph (independent track; needs a Neo4j Aura instance)
