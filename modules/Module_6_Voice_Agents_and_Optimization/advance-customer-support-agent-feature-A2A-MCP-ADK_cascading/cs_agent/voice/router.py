"""WebSocket voice endpoint — orchestrates the cascade around the UNTOUCHED text pipeline.

Turn model (accumulate-and-combine):
  * The user can speak in several bursts. Each burst is transcribed (STT) and APPENDED
    to a pending buffer, so the query grows: "status of my order" + "and summary of
    last month".
  * Whenever the user starts speaking again, any answer in progress is STOPPED
    (the agent turn is cancelled) — the user is still adding to their question.
  * When the user goes quiet for SETTLE_MS, the WHOLE combined buffer is sent through
    sanitize -> A2A Judge -> ADK agent (+MCP tools, Mem0) -> A2A Masker -> streamed TTS.
The Judge/agent/Masker are the exact objects web.py uses for /api/chat — nothing dupes.

Protocol (see ui.js for the client side):
  client -> server   binary frame              one speech burst, 16-bit PCM mono @16kHz
  client -> server   {"type":"interrupt"}      user started speaking: stop the answer
  server -> client   {"type":"partial_transcript","text":...}   combined query so far
  server -> client   {"type":"processing"}     combined query sent to the agent
  server -> client   {"type":"tool_call"|"response_text"|"blocked"|"timing"
                      |"cost"|"turn_end"|"error", ...}
                      timing.stages = durations {judge, stt, [mask]} + timeline
                      offsets from turn start {agent_start, agent_end, tts_start,
                      tts_end} + total_response (stt + whole answer pipeline);
                      cost = {"total": usd, "stages": {stage: {in,out,usd,measured}}}
