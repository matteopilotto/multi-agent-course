"""
run_bench.py — drive BOTH voice servers with ONE neutral stopwatch.

Why a neutral stopwatch: each server times itself, but from different zero points
(the cascade counts its speech->text step in its total; S2S starts its clock only
after it has already understood the audio). Comparing their self-reported totals is
biased. So this harness ignores those totals for the head-to-head and runs its OWN
stopwatch, identically for both:

    start  = the instant we finish sending the clip's audio   (same event, both archs)
    ttfa   = first response-audio byte arrives    (time-to-first-audio)
    total  = the turn's "done" signal arrives      (audio fully MADE, not played)

Both sides count whatever they actually do after the audio is delivered — the
cascade's real STT, S2S's real (tiny) recognition tail — truthfully and symmetrically.

We STILL save each server's own timing/cost events verbatim (under "raw") as the
"why" behind the number, but the comparison uses latency_measured.* only.

Feeding differs by design (each server wants its native input style):
  * cascade: the whole clip as ONE burst  -> one STT pass -> 1.5s settle -> answer
  * s2s:     realtime-paced PCM chunks     -> Live VAD ends the turn -> answer

Run one clip first to sanity-check the record, then scale up:
    python run_bench.py --arch s2s     --only q01 --repeats 1
    python run_bench.py --arch cascade --only q01 --repeats 1
    python run_bench.py --arch both --reseed      --repeats 3

Prereqs: the relevant server(s) running (cascade web :8000, s2s voice :8001), the
stack up (Postgres, Toolbox :5000, A2A :10002), MASK=false, and a clean per-pass
baseline. This harness reseeds the DB automatically BETWEEN the two passes of an
`--arch both` run so each architecture starts identical; pass --reseed to also seed
before the first pass (or seed by hand with ./run.sh seed).
